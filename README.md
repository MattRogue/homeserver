# Home Server
This repository documents all development related to my home server.

# Roadmap
1. Use Pfsense as router (ongoing - undocumented)
2. Build NAS and install into home system (ongoing - undocumented)

_This project is a hobby and therefore will be slowly implemented with no specific time frame, more tasks will be added overtime._
